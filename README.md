# Smart Grid Energy Management System

This project develops an intelligent energy management system for a residential smart grid equipped with solar panels and battery storage, utilizing Model Predictive Control (MPC). The system strategically optimizes energy costs by determining the optimal times to buy, sell, or store energy, based on real-time data and future predictions.

Below is an example of the optimal control generated by the smart grid energy management system:

## System Components

### 1. Solar Production (`solar_simulator.py`)
- Simulates solar panel energy production
- Uses real historical data from San Diego
- Falls back to a bell curve model when historical data isn't available
- Accounts for time of day, month, and seasonal variations

### 2. Consumption Simulator (`consumption_simulator.py`)
- Simulates residential energy consumption patterns
- Models daily usage variations:
  - Morning peak (breakfast time)
  - Evening peak (dinner time)
  - Lower usage during mid-day
  - Base load for always-on appliances
- Accounts for:
  - Time of day effects
  - Weekday vs weekend patterns
  - Seasonal variations
- Provides realistic consumption forecasts for optimization

### 3. Price Forecast (`price_forecast.py`)
- Predicts electricity prices for future time periods
- Features:
  - Time-of-use pricing patterns
  - Peak/off-peak rate differentiation
  - Dynamic price variations
  - Historical price analysis
- Considers:
  - Time of day impact

## Model Predictive Control (MPC) Formulation


- Sets and Indices
  - $t \in \{1,\ldots,T\}$: Time steps in the prediction horizon
  - $T$: Length of prediction horizon (24 hours)

- Parameters
  - $p_t^b$: Electricity buying price at time $t$ [$/kWh]
  - $p_t^s$: Electricity selling price at time $t$ [$/kWh]
  - $s_t$: Solar power production at time $t$ [kW]
  - $d_t$: Home power consumption at time $t$ [kW]
  - $C$: Battery capacity [kWh]
  - $C_{min}$: Minimum battery state of charge ($0.2C$) [kWh]
  - $r_{max}^c$: Maximum battery charging rate [kW]
  - $r_{max}^d$: Maximum battery discharging rate [kW]
  - $\eta$: Battery charging/discharging efficiency (0.95)
  - $A$: Grid connection ampacity limit [kW]
  - $SoC_0$: Initial battery state of charge [kWh]

- Decision Variables
  - $b_t$: Battery power flow at time $t$ [kW]
    - $b_t > 0$: charging
    - $b_t < 0$: discharging
  - $g_t$: Grid power flow at time $t$ [kW]
    - $g_t > 0$: buying
    - $g_t < 0$: selling

- State Variables
  - $SoC_t$: Battery state of charge at time $t$ [kWh]

- Objective Function
  - Maximize profit (minimize negative profit):
    $$\min_{b_t,g_t} \sum_{t=1}^T \left(g_t^+ p_t^b - g_t^- p_t^s\right)$$
    where:
      - $g_t^+ = \max(g_t, 0)$: Power bought from grid
      - $g_t^- = \max(-g_t, 0)$: Power sold to grid

- Constraints

  - Power Balance Constraint:
     $$d_t = s_t - b_t + g_t \quad \forall t$$

  - Battery State of Charge Evolution:
    - For charging ($b_t \geq 0$):
       $$SoC_{t+1} = SoC_t + b_t\eta \quad \forall t$$

    - For discharging ($b_t < 0$):
       $$SoC_{t+1} = SoC_t + \frac{b_t}{\eta} \quad \forall t$$

  - Battery Capacity Constraints:
     $$C_{min} \leq SoC_t \leq C \quad \forall t$$

  - Battery Power Flow Limits:
     $$-r_{max}^d \leq b_t \leq r_{max}^c \quad \forall t$$

  - Grid Power Flow Limits:
     $$-A \leq g_t \leq A \quad \forall t$$

  - Initial Condition:
     $$SoC_1 = SoC_0$$


## Usage

- Tune the parameters in config.py
   - mode = 'mid_prod'  # total production = total consumption
   - n_day = 366  # number of days to simulate
   - n_day_figure = 1  # number of days to plot
   - use_battery = True  # whether to use battery
   - n_battery = 2  # number of batteries
